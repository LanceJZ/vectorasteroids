    CONSOLE APPLICATION : VectorAsteroids Project Overview
========================================================================

A clone of the original Atari Asteroids. This was a learning experience for me, for learning C++ and making games with it.
 I started learning C++ about a month ago, and this is how far I've gotten today.
 I hope someone learns from my work, and that it helps someone. Thank you for your time.

VectorAsteroids.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

VectorAsteroids.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

VectorAsteroids.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named VectorAsteroids.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
